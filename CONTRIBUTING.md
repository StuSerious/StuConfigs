This project is born as a collection of macros to be used in [Fluidd](https://github.com/cadriel/fluidd), and therefore I integrate *some* of Cadriel's contributing criteria on this repo:

- A clean develop is preferred. This means squashing, and rebasing your feature branches prior to merge.
- PRs should be made off a branch other than develop or main.
- Commit messages should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard, for example:

  ```sh
  feat: My feature.

  Some description.
  ```

- By committing, you acknowledge that you agree to the [developer certificate of origin](.github/developer-certificate-of-origin).
This must contain your name and a current email address.
